# gog-galaxy-itch.io

An integration for itch.io

It's a bit of a hack at the moment (hardcoded paths to the itch clients db, useless oauth2 signin), but hey it works
please use the download via the releases page as the repo itself does not contain any dependencies

Also feel free to create an issue if something doesn't work for you :)
