# gog-galaxy-itch.io

An integration for itch.io

It's a bit of a hack at the moment (hardcoded paths to the itch clients db, useless oauth2 signin), but hey it works.
Please use the download [via the releases page](https://github.com/Ertego/gog-galaxy-itch.io/releases/tag/0.0.1) as the repo itself does not contain any dependencies

Also feel free to create an issue if something doesn't work for you :)
