# gog-galaxy-itch.io

*There is also a version that supports showing all owned games, but some features of this version are not yet implemented there*
[WebAPI version by tauqua](https://github.com/tauqua/gog-galaxy-itch.io)

# README

An integration for itch.io

It's a bit of a hack at the moment (hardcoded paths to the itch clients db, useless oauth2 signin), but hey it works.
Please use the download [via the releases page](https://github.com/Ertego/gog-galaxy-itch.io/releases) as the repo itself does not contain any dependencies.
Also please note that you have to have the itch launcher installed at the default location!

Also feel free to create an issue if something doesn't work for you :)

## Current Features
* Show games installed through the itch client in Gog Galaxy 2
* Launch games

## Features planned to be added
* Show (not yet installed) purchases in your library
* Install purchased games

## Installation
1. Download the plugin from the releases page.
2. Copy the downloaded ZIP to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed`
   which is the same location as `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\GOG.com\Galaxy\plugins\installed`, but the first one can be copy-pasted
3. Unzip
4. (Optional) Delete the zip to save space
